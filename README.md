# odin-recipes
I am going to create a basic (simple) static website using only HTML. I am currently undertaking The Odin Project's course and this is an exercise that I have to do. 
For this task I need to creat a website with links pointing to different recipes. I will show that I have som basic HTML knoweledge on this matter. 
Thank you for your support!
