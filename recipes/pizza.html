    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you follow these simple steps you will enjoy an amazing home-made pizza at your home! It is healthier to prepare your Pizza at home and use fresh products instead of buying the <em>ultra-processed</em>pizzas that you see in the supermarket </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 gr of weat</li>
        <li>200 ml of water</li>
        <li>6 gr of yeast</li>
        <li>200 gr of pomodoro</li>
        <li>Fresh basilic</li>
        <li>Burrata</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>first you need to pour 200 ml of water inside a bowl with 200 gr of weat, some salt and 6 gr of yeast. </p>
        <p>Then you need to knead the dought until it reaches a firm consistency. Don't forget to add salt and a spoon of honey for a better result. Afterwards the dought needs to rest for about 30 minutes, and then you separate the dought in two slices and lave them rest for an hour</p>
        <p>Finally  you can take the dought and form the base of the pizza. Pre-heat the oven at 250ºC for about 30 minutes. It is better to use a slab stone for a better result. You put then <em> the pomodoro </em> on top of the pizza and baked it for about 7 minutes</p>
        <p>When you take out the pizza, put the rest of the ingredients on top: the burrata and the fresh basilic... and <b> enjoy!</b></p>
