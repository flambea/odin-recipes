        <li>peel the potatoes and cut them very thin. That is the first important trick. Make thin and small slices </li>
        <li>put enough oil to fry the potatoes, and put them when the oil is hot enough. You don't want to fry the potatoes fast, it is a slow process . Mince the garlic and put it in the pan when the potatoes are nearly done </li>
        <li>beat the 5 eggs in a bowl. When the potatoes are done retire them and put them inside the bowl. Leave the potatoes in the bowl for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are in the bowl resting, retire the excess of oil and leave enough oil to make the final omelete... and <b> enjoy!</b></li>
        <li>Put all the ingredients on the pan and with a wood spoon brake constantly the surface in order to make a solid cooked base. Then you need to flip the omelet using a plate or the cover of the pan</li>
        <li>You can cook the omelete as long as you want, but it tastes better when it is more liquid</li>
